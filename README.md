## UwU++ : Degeneracy evolved©

### warning: WIP

* Have you ever felt that you can't express yourself with todays languages? <br>
* Do you have problem of being too respected as a programmer/human being? <br>
* Are you a person who enjoys pain? <br>

UwU++ is a imperative programming language which aims to compete with brainf*ck to be the most painfull programming language to read and write in.
As the next evolution of UwU-Lang, it retains all of the "charm" with new features like:

* Arrays
* Functions
* <,=,> comparators
* division,minus operators
* If statements
* Actual error messages in the parser
* Runtime printing

TODO:
* Compiler
* Webasm target

## Code example:
